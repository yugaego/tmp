**Before asking a question**
1. Read [installation and usage information](http://company-mode.github.io).
2. Read `C-h f company-mode` documentation.
3. Review [Wiki articles](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/wiki/Tips-&-tricks).
4. Search in [existing issues](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues?q=).
5. Make sure this is a `company-mode` related question, rather than one of the [third-party package](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/wiki/Third-Party-Packages) one.

If you have more general `Emacs` question: first consult `C-h r` Emacs manual, then send email to [help-gnu-emacs](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs) mailing list.
